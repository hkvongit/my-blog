In real life most of the things we do for living are not things we are interested to.\\n\\n## Time perception\\n\\nOne of the major challenge ADHD people face is the time perception. This is the reason why they procrastinate. But the interesting thing is that if they are given a deadline they can somehow perceive time very well.\\n\\n## Piling system\\n\\nADHD people use a piling system for organising and most of the time it may not work for them.\\n\\n## Working memory\\n\\nPeople with ADHD can have teriffic memory of the past events, upcoming events however one vital memory called working memory is not proper for them.\\n\\nWorking memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain so that you can use it in immediate or short term. Example if someone verbally given their phone number and when you tries to type on your phone/ book you forget it immediately.\\n\\n## Dopamine\\n\\nIt is a neuro-modulator and creates hightened state of focus. It tends to shrink our visual world and it makes us pay attention to the things outside and beyond the confines of our skin/ physical work. Dopamine is a drive to do something in the physical world.\\n\\nIt also has role in changing the way we perceive the world.\\n\\nProper production of dopamine will narrow our visual and auditory world.\\n\\n## Neural circuits\\n\\nThere are 2 main cirucuits w.r.t attention and dopammine in ADHD.\\n\\n1. Default mode network\\n2. Task Mode Network\\n\\n### 1. Default Mode Network\\n\\n- Network which are active when we are not doing anything.\\n- Default mode network include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (front-top-side part of the brain ).\\n\\n### 2. Task mode Network\\n\\n- Network which is goal oriented. It is a different set of brain area from default mode Network.\\n- It is also in prefrontal cortex but in diffent part to default mode network. It is at Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPC in short, Front Centre part of the brain ).\\n- MPC communicates with other parts of the brain mainly to suppress the impulses. It is shutting down your desire to stand up or scratch the side of the cheek.\\n\\nBut there is communication btw task mode and default mode networks.\\n\\nThe two networks have a lot of communication in a neuro-typical person. But in a person with ADHD or a person with low sleep the 2 networks are not synchronized.\\n\\nIn a neuro-typical person the default mode and task mode networks are anti-correlated. That is they are opposing to each other to balance one another. But in a person with ADHD these 2 networks are co-related and they cannot control or balance each other.\\n\\nWhat #dopamine is doing in this context is that it is acting as a conductor in a musical concert which make sure which mode should be active at a particular time. That is dopamine make them anti-corelated and helps balance each other.\\n\\nThis raises 2 questions in ADHD, whether #dopamine is not sufficiantly high enough levels or #dopamine conducting everything wrong.\\n\\n## Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse.\\n\\nIn year 2015m a research paper came but in an excellent journal in Biological Psychiatry (Author name: Spencer). This paper normalizes the fact of low dopamine hypothesis in ADHD.\\n\\nIt explains when dopamine levels are too low in particular areas of the brain, it leads to unnecessary firing of the neurons in the brain which is unrelated to the task we are trying to do. It can be like an instrumental concert without a conductor.\\n\\nEven before such dopamine deficient hypothesis, in 1940s and 1960s we can see such people with ADHD tend to use recreational drugs or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants such as coffee, espresso or smoking half pack of cigarettes. Some others with access to street drugs they used cocaine, amphetamine etc.\\n\\nAll these drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the brain especially in the regions which regulate attention and task related and default mode networks.\\n\\nSome children who do not have access to any of these drugs can be seen easting too much sugary food, coke which creates a sudden rush in dopamine.This makes them able to calm themselves. But when children who do not have ADHD consumes this they will become hyperactive due to enormously high production of dopamine.\\n\\n**\\"LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE WITH ADHD.\\"**\\n\\nThus giving dopamine energic compounds to people with ADHD will somehow increase the ability to focus.\\n\\nSo major drugs developed and marketed by pharmaceutical companies are\\n\\n1. Ritalin\\n2. Adderral\\n3. Modafinil\\n\\nThese all drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the regions of brains that manages the 2 modes.\\n\\n### Ritalin\\n\\n- Ritalin is a stimulus prescribed for ADHD and narcolepsy (Condition in which people tend to fall asleep during the day time quite a lot, excessive day time sleepiness and also may sleep when they get excited).\\n- Ritalin is the oldest drug in use.\\n\\n- Ritalin also called as **methylphenidate** [ METH-il-FEN-i-date ]\\n\\n### Addrell\\n\\nAddrell is now the most prescribed drug for treating ADHD.\\n\\nBoth Addrell and Modafinil helps to treat narcolepsy as well.\\n\\n## Pharmaco-kinetics (Kinetics means movement)\\n\\n(This term means how the drug works.)\\n\\nAll these drugs are share the almost same compounds as cocaine and meth which are greatly habit forming and abusive.\\nThey are not exactly the same as meth or cocaine but similar. Their net effect in the brain and body is the same which is to increase the dopamine but also the levels of neuro-modulators called epinephrine or neurotransmitter, also called as noradrenaline amd to some extend increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and blood.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Serotine** is more about feeling calm and relaxed.\\n:::\\n\\nIt is good to prescribe stimulants early i life and it will be effective as neuroplasticity of brain decreases as we age.\\n\\nWe should discourage the use of street drugs of any kind as there is nobody to regulate the dosage and also quality is not assured. Also we do not need such heavy dosage for an ADHD person.\\n\\n25-35% of college students and working professionals in US (in age between 17 t 35) use black market Addrell to function properly and focus on their daily life even though they are not diagnosed by ADHD. Now consumption of Addrelll without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis at age group of 17-30.\\n\\n### Nicotin and Caffine\\n\\nNicotine and Caffeine are also used in high amount for energy of focus, Nicotine should not be used due to high risk of cancer.\\n\\n## Case study on children\\n\\nIn this research Andrew Huberman came across a couple who are in close relationship with him. A child of them have ADHD and the parents have deep knowledge in ADHD. So Huberman asked some questions to them:\\n\\n1. Will you give Amphetamine to their kid ?\\n   Answer from the couple was that they will use the lowest dosage required and moderate as they grow up which will help them learn attention. This will benefit the kid in a larger way.\\n\\n## Food control\\n\\n- Controlling allergic food like gluten, milk, sugar helps to control the hyper activity.\\n- Elimination of simple sugars and high sugar are highly appreciated.\\n- Avoiding all the food allergic is not ideal as it can cause severe auto-immune issues when consumed accidentally.\\n\\n### Omega 3 fatty acids\\n\\n- Getting **1000 mg** or more of Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil), which known to have anti-depressant effects works better for people with ADHD as well.\\n- It also benefits the immune system, cardio vascular system.\\n\\n:::info\\nAll these regarding food control are good but their effect on focus and attention is only modest, THey have only modulatory role like sleep in ADHD.\\n:::\\n\\n## Behavioural changes to adapt\\n\\nHuberman suggest a book called **\\"Altered traits\\"**.\\n\\nPeople with ADHD will have attentional blink which is a condition when you are in a race for finding multiple things, you may involved in finding one of them but misses the second one. For e.e. reading a documentation and finding a single thing but misses others, this is because ADHD people are over focused in finding a particular piece of information. This is called as **attentional blinks** and it is more in ADHD people than in normal people.\\n\\n> _Over focusing on something and not able to realize other things._\\n\\n:::danger This attention blink can be scientifically regulated by:\\n\\n1. Changing the focus of pupil in the eyes.\\n2. Closing the eyes and listening to your body, touch and breathing.\\n3. Blink your eyes less.\\n   :::"}]}}')}}]);
