        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are hundreds of programming frameworks, but we need to select the one for our needs. Here I explain why I choose certain frameworks for certain needs based on my needs and philosophy.</p>
<p>On my previous blog posts I have mentioned that I have ADHD and neck pain, these conditions makes me a lot different from the my peers. My main problems with this condition are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot sit and work for more than 30 minutes at a single shot. I need to take breaks for avoiding neck pain.</li>
<li>Lack of motivation on doing a long term task like a large project.</li>
<li>Needs clear vision before starting anything long term.</li>
<li>Cannot remember lot of things at once due to a short memory capacity (low RAM but hard disk is good 😁).</li>
<li>Lack of focus and making the mistakes that no others obviously do in their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all these, I need to get a different approach in my work whether it from choosing the right framework to the time I wake in the morning.</p>
<p>For anyone having ADHD or similar condition I think this blog will give some insights.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Batteries must be included</strong>: I am not that good in finding 3rd party packages for each projects I do.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to write and deploy</strong>: I cannot stand in front of languages like Java or C# or C++. I believe, I am not an intelligent person to write such great code and also I need to do program quickly so that I can spend time in designing or spend time with my family and friends.</li>
<li><strong>Convention over configuration</strong>: It should be easy to configure and follow the conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Very less complexity</strong>: My ADHD brain always likes simple things which are understandable to a 10 year old.</li>

<p>I prefer Javascript based frameworks now. Since it is the only programming language we can use to build browser applications, instead of learning multiple languages to build web based things I prefer Javascript. Javascript was the first programming language I used for work and I believe it was the sole reason I became resistant to learn any other language and I know it is bad. But I learned some other languages and tried some frameworks as well.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="any-problem-with-javascript-">Any problem with Javascript ?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Any problem with Javascript ?" title="Direct link to Any problem with Javascript ?" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/choose-programming-frameworks-based-on-needs#any-problem-with-javascript-">​</a></h3>
<p>Yes, since js is dynamically typed I make a lot of mistakes and it gives critical bugs in live web application/sites. Thus personally I do everything in Typescript. It helps me to do programming relatively safer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="any-problem-with-typescript-">Any problem with Typescript ?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Any problem with Typescript ?" title="Direct link to Any problem with Typescript ?" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/choose-programming-frameworks-based-on-needs#any-problem-with-typescript-">​</a></h3>
<p>Yes definitely, since you need to mention all parameter types, it frustrates me a lot. Instead of writing logic for my application I end up doing this finding and writing types for different params for any 3rd party library I use. One thing I learned later is giving type <code>any</code> is of no problem in case I am in a hurry to deliver my work.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://adonisjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adonis js</a> is the only battery included fullstack framework in the typescript ecosystem. It is reliable. It has lot of get go features. It helps me avoid finding the next best 3rd party library for lots of use cases.</li>
<li>It has a very good documentation.</li>
<li>I prefer to use it whenever a product idea comes to me via client or myself.</li>
<li>Frankly you don't need adonis for a simple landing or e-commerce website.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cms">CMS<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CMS" title="Direct link to CMS" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/choose-programming-frameworks-based-on-needs#cms">​</a></h3>
<p>For some simple content management system I prefer to use Strapi CMS or Directus. If you are a fullstack developer who is working alone, it will be handy to develop websites ultra fast for your clients. I prefer Directus over Strapi due to the their philosophy. Strapi have a buggy documentation. Both Directus and Strapi are headless CMS.</p>
<p>If I use a headless CMS, I use Next.js for building frontend for better SEO and to use client side interactive react js packages for visually appealing UIs.</p>

<p>Yes. I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Laravel (PHP)</li>
<li>Ruby on rails</li>
<li>Django with Python</li>
</ol>
<p>These three are very good frameworks but for me there were issues in using it. It is only my problems. Thousands of developer use this frameworks daily to ship great projects.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Laravel</strong>: Syntax of PHP was little difficult for me and suggestions in vscode was not that great. As a typescript developer I missed it.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby on rails</strong>: I am a fan of DHH (founder of Ruby). His numerous philosophies influence me.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Rails is a beautiful languages but it lacks IDE support (no code suggestion, intellisense), I tried setting up it but failed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Ruby also got very less vacancies in tech and hence very less people learning it. If I needed some additional help from a freelancer, it is extremely difficult to find such a person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I started making lot of silly mistakes on writing ruby due to my condition and lack of strict types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Django with Python</strong>
It was a good experience learning python and django. Problems I faced were:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I make silly mistakes due to lack of strictness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I was not able to find a good CMS with it. Lot of my freelance work requires a CMS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/choose-programming-frameworks-based-on-needs#conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>After all these research I find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>No framework is perfect and lot of great developers love their stack for different reasons.</li>
<li>We should make something useful for our clients and ourselves rather than finding the best thing.</li>
<li>Javascript ecosystem is messed up by the VC funded startups and everyday they launch new tools with no proper vision or philosophy. They change the way we use programs now and then for making us use their infrastructure.They just needed to make great money by making ourselves use their proprietary cloud system. I don't want to bite it. Vercel with Next.js is an example for this. I loved Next.js initially but their approach with app router got me thinking why these people keep changing standards.</li>
<li>My conditions are different than most others, so I am the person who need to setup a simple and maintainable stack for my use cases.</li>
<li>I am a <a href="https://x.com/dhh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHH</a> fan now but I use my sense before agreeing to his ideas. I gone through his talks and articles during learning <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. He taught me <em>simplicity is derived by hard work and passion</em>. Most of the things we see as <strong>simple</strong> where built above some serious thinking.</li>

<p>Frameworks provide a collection of pre-styled components and utility classes, reducing the need to write custom CSS from scratch.</p>
<p>I prefer to use <strong>Tailwind</strong>.</p>
<p>If you can check <strong><a href="https://daisyui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy UI</a></strong>, It is great UI library built over tailwind and it is highly customizable. I am too lazy for creating accordions, modal etc from scratch, so I use daisy ui for a skeleton and style it with tailwind as per my need.</p>

<p>Learn CSS GRID, especially grid areas. It will make your styling lot easier.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PostCSS</strong>: A tool that processes your CSS with plugins that can optimize, transform, and lint your styles.</li>
<li><strong>Autoprefixer</strong>: A PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS, ensuring better cross-browser compatibility.</li>

<p>Using a bg-primary-500 style then setting primary color in tailwind config. Great for reusable components between projects, or when you're not totally clear on what the accent color will be. Or for multiple components in one project you can usually use find replace across files or multi-cursor mode within a file to change classes.</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS - consider this above JS.</li>
<li>Any simple JS framework. Astro or Next js with static build. (This is only needed if you need to use some npm package which you know makes you work easy). Use tailwind and CSS grid.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HOSTING</strong>: This can be hosted on any small server on linode or digitalocean with nginx (shared hosting for multiple sites reduces the cost by a large margin, a $5 machine will be enough). You can also use cloudflare pages for this purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Backend</strong>: Strapi CMS, it provide an advanced admin panel.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Next js for SEO friendly application needs but React js if SEO is not a concern. I recommend React only if you have to build a web application over a website.</li>

<p>During the initial phase of my career I was totally into corporate jobs and I learned React JS for landing a job. I got a job in a good company which had about 50-100 employees. I was interested in learning React and JavaScript. I was working in a project which automated testing process in the telecom. My job was to create functional and aesthetic user interfaces for showing the results of the test, preparing test setup and configuration and also a great dashboard. My team was working with meteor js which is a realtime web framework along with React for creating web app.</p>
<p>The stack used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meteor js</li>
<li>React js with vanilla CSS + Material UI</li>
<li>Mongo DB</li>
</ul>
<p>There were hurdles in the way and we later realized meteor.js has some issue which prevented us to make the web app dynamic with our use case and also the backend architecture also needed an improvement.
So our lead has proposed a plan to shift the pure React js and the backend needed to create Rest APIs for each and every data points and actions.</p>
<p>React js is one the greatest library I have learned which really solved almost all the problems we came across. There were lot of npm packages which helped us to deliver complex use cases easily and quickly.</p>
<p>There my role was to ensure the frontend of the web application meet the expectation of my team.</p>
<p>I thought this is it for frontend.</p>
<p>Gradually I moved up my position and learned more about backend. I also got improved in my people management and communication skill.</p>

<p>From my childhood I had a dream of working independently and starting a business. Me and my friends started a small company without much investments after resigning my full time job.</p>
<p>Our company basically took service based projects were clients provided us money and target to create web applications. From a job to business I learned it is lot different to get projects and complete the project on time. We should clever enough to negotiate with client and employees. We will always have time and budget constrains.</p>
<p>Initial projects were frontend work only, since we had experience in that stack it was easy to convince the client. Some other team will do the backend and we do the frontend.</p>
<p>Client was always complaining about our development speed. May be a reason was strict rules we set in programming which we inherited from our job. Later on we loosened it someway.</p>
<p>Stack used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: React js</li>
<li>Hosting: Linode or AWS.</li>
<li>Backend: Java Spring Boot (Another team)</li>
</ul>
<p>Couple of projects we have done was MVPs and didn't took of from that phase.</p>
<p>During 2023, we were getting less to no new projects, may be the market was down due to different economic situations. The projects we got also had very small budgets but there were significant features to do.</p>
<p>We brainstormed how we can achieve such a project. The solution was choose right frameworks for those projects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="javascript-eco-system">Javascript eco-system<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Javascript eco-system" title="Direct link to Javascript eco-system" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#javascript-eco-system">​</a></h3>
<p>It is a mess, fragmented and mostly unopinionated. I think JS eco-system is relatively new compared to PHP, Ruby or Java, especially node js.</p>
<p>I give full support for choosing js based frameworks or libraries for startups which have enough funds to invent their wheel and move forward.</p>
<p>But our case was different. We always had to fight with the competition for money and timeline to get projects.</p>
<p>We learned next js, tried it for couple of projects which required SEO and features like payment and data processing.</p>
<p>We leaned Nest js (Backend framework based on Node js and express). WHich was somewhat opinionated.</p>
<p>We used AWS amplify, cognito, API gateway etc. But nothing has improved our speed in development.</p>
<p>Then in one e-commerce project we tried Strapi. Awesome, it was great for the speed. We learned everything about strapi and wondered how their team developed such a great system. It was opinionated and thus we didn't wanted to think extensively or to always reinvent the wheel. It was an eye opening experience for me.</p>
<p>I am now exploring about other languages and frameworks that we could use achieve our projects easily and faster.</p>

<p>I know PHP is not as good as javascript, but PHP within Laravel was good. Now, I am learning Laravel. Laravel has the batteries to complete a project, I don't want to spend hours finding an npm package for authentication, encryption, ORM etc. I can start a Laravel project and start writing projects.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think I am not the brightest minds you find in the programming world. I am a person with an average IQ, with ADHD and a severe neck pain. But I have to do my job, make my client happy and make a living out of my work.</p>

<p>I never learned Ruby but there are strong fans for Ruby on Rails. I know DHH, and I agree with most of his choices in the business and programming. I have read an great reddit post on a senior engineer supporting Ruby over Rails, link is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1dkcegr/im_switching_from_laravel_to_rails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you like to see something like laravel for Javascript you should check Adonis JS. If you want to do project faster but not to learn a new language as a javascript developer, choose Adonis. Check their website <a href="https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/preface/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>I think Adonis is the unsung hero in the Javascript Eco-system.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Figma</strong> - Yes, you need to know it as a freelancer or independent web service provider. If you can't do it, outsource it to a good UI/UX designer. Clients value good designs.</li>
<li><strong>Photoshop</strong> - Optional. If you need to create great looking posters, assets etc. You need it. If you can't afford it check <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Affinity Photo</a>.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong> - It is hard to tell that I still struggle with css after 5 years of my programming. I am learning CSS over anything.</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> - Do you know HTML well, good HTML knowledge is needed for creating better SEO optimized sites.</li>
<li><strong>Next js</strong> - Use Next js for any kind of website work. It is so flexible but there is a learning curve.</li>
<li><strong>Strapi CMS</strong> - I cannot express more about my love towards Strapi to build CMS faster. Till I complete my Laravel learning, Strapi is my go to for my project.</li>
<li><strong>Laravel</strong> - I like it since it is opinionated. I am learning it since I want to deliver projects faster and cost effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Framer</strong> - If your client want a website immediately or unsure about want exactly she needs to put there after couple of months. Don't go coding, go for <a href="https://framer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framer</a>.</li>

<p>This is the only question I ask when communicating with my client and team.
Choose the framework for the needs, don't be a fan of a language or framework. Its all about making the client and their customers happy.</p>]]></content>

<p>People with ADHD have poor attention &amp; high impulsivity.
People with ADHD can have hyper-focus in things they really enjoy or intrigued by but they cannot simple focus on things that don't want to do. In real life most of the things we do for living are not things we are interested to.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-perception">Time perception<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Time perception" title="Direct link to Time perception" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#time-perception">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the major challenge ADHD people face is the time perception. This is the reason why they procrastinate. But the interesting thing is that if they are given a deadline they can somehow perceive time very well.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="piling-system">Piling system<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Piling system" title="Direct link to Piling system" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#piling-system">​</a></h2>
<p>ADHD people use a piling system for organizing and most of the time it may not work for them.</p>

<p>People with ADHD can have terrific memory of the past events, upcoming events however one vital memory called working memory is not proper for them.</p>
<p>Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain so that you can use it in immediate or short term. Example if someone verbally given their phone number and when you tries to type on your phone/ book you forget it immediately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dopamine">Dopamine<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dopamine" title="Direct link to Dopamine" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#dopamine">​</a></h2>
<p>It is a neuro-modulator and creates hightened state of focus. It tends to shrink our visual world and it makes us pay attention to the things outside and beyond the confines of our skin/ physical work. Dopamine is a drive to do something in the physical world.</p>
<p>It also has role in changing the way we perceive the world.</p>
<p>Proper production of dopamine will narrow our visual and auditory world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="neural-circuits">Neural circuits<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Neural circuits" title="Direct link to Neural circuits" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#neural-circuits">​</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 main circuits w.r.t attention and dopamine in ADHD.</p>
<ol>
<li>Default mode network</li>
<li>Task Mode Network</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-default-mode-network">1. Default Mode Network<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Default Mode Network" title="Direct link to 1. Default Mode Network" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#1-default-mode-network">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Network which are active when we are not doing anything.</li>
<li>Default mode network include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (front-top-side part of the brain ).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-task-mode-network">2. Task mode Network<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Task mode Network" title="Direct link to 2. Task mode Network" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#2-task-mode-network">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Network which is goal oriented. It is a different set of brain area from default mode Network.</li>
<li>It is also in prefrontal cortex but in different part to default mode network. It is at Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPC in short, Front Centre part of the brain ).</li>
<li>MPC communicates with other parts of the brain mainly to suppress the impulses. It is shutting down your desire to stand up or scratch the side of the cheek.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there is communication btw task mode and default mode networks.</p>
<p>The two networks have a lot of communication in a neuro-typical person. But in a person with ADHD or a person with low sleep the 2 networks are not synchronized.</p>
<p>In a neuro-typical person the default mode and task mode networks are anti-correlated. That is they are opposing to each other to balance one another. But in a person with ADHD these 2 networks are co-related and they cannot control or balance each other.</p>
<p>What #dopamine is doing in this context is that it is acting as a conductor in a musical concert which make sure which mode should be active at a particular time. That is dopamine make them anti-correlated and helps balance each other.</p>
<p>This raises 2 questions in ADHD, whether #dopamine is not sufficiently high enough levels or #dopamine conducting everything wrong.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="low-dopamine-in-adhd-stimulant-use-and-abuse">Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse.<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse." title="Direct link to Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse." href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#low-dopamine-in-adhd-stimulant-use-and-abuse">​</a></h2>
<p>In year 2015m a research paper came but in an excellent journal in Biological Psychiatry (Author name: Spencer). This paper normalizes the fact of low dopamine hypothesis in ADHD.</p>
<p>It explains when dopamine levels are too low in particular areas of the brain, it leads to unnecessary firing of the neurons in the brain which is unrelated to the task we are trying to do. It can be like an instrumental concert without a conductor.</p>
<p>Even before such dopamine deficient hypothesis, in 1940s and 1960s we can see such people with ADHD tend to use recreational drugs or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants such as coffee, espresso or smoking half pack of cigarettes. Some others with access to street drugs they used cocaine, amphetamine etc.</p>
<p>All these drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the brain especially in the regions which regulate attention and task related and default mode networks.</p>
<p>Some children who do not have access to any of these drugs can be seen easting too much sugary food, coke which creates a sudden rush in dopamine.This makes them able to calm themselves. But when children who do not have ADHD consumes this they will become hyperactive due to enormously high production of dopamine.</p>
<p><strong>"LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE WITH ADHD."</strong></p>
<p>Thus giving dopamine energic compounds to people with ADHD will somehow increase the ability to focus.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="drugs">Drugs<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drugs" title="Direct link to Drugs" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#drugs">​</a></h2>
<p>So major drugs developed and marketed by pharmaceutical companies are</p>
<ol>
<li>Ritalin</li>
<li>Adderral</li>
<li>Modafinil</li>
</ol>
<p>These all drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the regions of brains that manages the 2 modes.</p>

<li>
<p>Ritalin is the oldest drug in use.</p>

<p>(This term means how the drug works.)</p>
<p>All these drugs are share the almost same compounds as cocaine and meth which are greatly habit forming and abusive.
They are not exactly the same as meth or cocaine but similar. Their net effect in the brain and body is the same which is to increase the dopamine but also the levels of neuro-modulators called epinephrine or neurotransmitter, also called as noradrenaline amd to some extend increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and blood.</p>

<p>It is good to prescribe stimulants early i life and it will be effective as neuroplasticity of brain decreases as we age.</p>
<p>We should discourage the use of street drugs of any kind as there is nobody to regulate the dosage and also quality is not assured. Also we do not need such heavy dosage for an ADHD person.</p>
<p>25-35% of college students and working professionals in US (in age between 17 t 35) use black market Addrell to function properly and focus on their daily life even though they are not diagnosed by ADHD. Now consumption of Addrell without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis at age group of 17-30.</p>

<p>Huberman suggest a book called <strong>"Altered traits"</strong>.</p>
<p>People with ADHD will have attentional blink which is a condition when you are in a race for finding multiple things, you may involved in finding one of them but misses the second one. For e.e. reading a documentation and finding a single thing but misses others, this is because ADHD people are over focused in finding a particular piece of information. This is called as <strong>attentional blinks</strong> and it is more in ADHD people than in normal people.</p>

<ul>
<li>Modafinil is highly expensive (800 to 1000 dollars per month).</li>
<li>Armodafinil is a lesser expensive version of modafinil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike Ritalin &amp; Addrell, Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil are weak dopamine re-update inhibitors and thats how they lead ti increase in dopamine.
Modafinil helps to sustain a lower dose of dopamine in brain for a longer time.</p>
<p>Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil also affects other systems such as orexin system (it regulates hunger) and also regulate sleep.</p>

<p>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that are at the neurons to muscle connections called neuromuscular connections which helps movements of muscles of all kind.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is produced in two sites of the brain</p>
<ol>
<li>Projections in the brain stem, like a sprinkle system which release Acetylcholine.</li>
<li>Set of neurons at the basel forebrain called Nucleus Basalis which simply means nucleus of the base.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drugs that enhances the production of Acetylcholine improves focus and cognition. One such drug/compound is Alpha GPC.</p>
<p>Dosage of Alpha GPC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower 200 to 300mg</li>
<li>Higher 1200mg</li>
</ul>

<p>It is an amino acid which is pre-cursor to the dopamine. L - Tyrosine helps production of dopamine, They are fairly long lived and it helps in focus but the dosage is very tricky.</p>
<p>It sometimes makes us euphoric and alert despite taking a regular dosage.</p>
<p>Dosage varies from 100mg to 1200mg. It should be used with caution.</p>

<p>It is illegal in some countries. It can be seen in gray markets.</p>
<p>They have different margins of safety. you should definitely consult a doctor for this.</p>
<p>Noopept is a Recetam, it taps into the Cholinergic system, the Acetylcholine system which is very similar to Alpha-GPC but shown a heightened level of cognitive capacity.</p>
