<p>Frameworks provide a collection of pre-styled components and utility classes, reducing the need to write custom CSS from scratch.</p>
<p>I prefer to use <strong>Tailwind</strong>.</p>
<p>If you can check <strong><a href="https://daisyui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy UI</a></strong>, It is great UI library built over tailwind and it is highly customizable. I am too lazy for creating accordions, modal etc from scratch, so I use daisy ui for a skeleton and style it with tailwind as per my need.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PostCSS</strong>: A tool that processes your CSS with plugins that can optimize, transform, and lint your styles.</li>
<li><strong>Autoprefixer</strong>: A PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS, ensuring better cross-browser compatibility.</li>

<div class="language-js codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-js codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">module</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token property-access">exports</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">mode</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"jit"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">// other options</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p style="font-size:2rem;margin-top:2rem">TL;DR</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="initial-career">Initial career<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Initial career" title="Direct link to Initial career" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#initial-career">​</a></h2>
<p>During the initial phase of my career I was totally into corporate jobs and I learned React JS for landing a job. I got a job in a good company which had about 50-100 employees. I was interested in learning React and JavaScript. I was working in a project which automated testing process in the telecom. My job was to create functional and aesthetic user interfaces for showing the results of the test, preparing test setup and configuration and also a great dashboard. My team was working with meteor js which is a realtime web framework along with React for creating web app.</p>
<p>The stack used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meteor js</li>
<li>React js with vanilla CSS + Material UI</li>
<li>Mongo DB</li>
</ul>
<p>There were hurdles in the way and we later realized meteor.js has some issue which prevented us to make the web app dynamic with our use case and also the backend architecture also needed an improvement.
So our lead has proposed a plan to shift the pure React js and the backend needed to create Rest APIs for each and every data points and actions.</p>
<p>React js is one the greatest library I have learned which really solved almost all the problems we came across. There were lot of npm packages which helped us to deliver complex use cases easily and quickly.</p>
<p>There my role was to ensure the frontend of the web application meet the expectation of my team.</p>
<p>I thought this is it for frontend.</p>
<p>Gradually I moved up my position and learned more about backend. I also got improved in my people management and communication skill.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-entrepreneurship">My entrepreneurship<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My entrepreneurship" title="Direct link to My entrepreneurship" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#my-entrepreneurship">​</a></h2>
<p>From my childhood I had a dream of working independently and starting a business. Me and my friends started a small company without much investments after resigning my full time job.</p>
<p>Our company basically took service based projects were clients provided us money and target to create web applications. From a job to business I learned it is lot different to get projects and complete the project on time. We should clever enough to negotiate with client and employees. We will always have time and budget constrains.</p>
<p>Initial projects were frontend work only, since we had experience in that stack it was easy to convince the client. Some other team will do the backend and we do the frontend.</p>
<p>Client was always complaining about our development speed. May be a reason was strict rules we set in programming which we inherited from our job. Later on we loosened it someway.</p>
<p>Stack used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: React js</li>
<li>Hosting: Linode or AWS.</li>
<li>Backend: Java Spring Boot (Another team)</li>
</ul>
<p>Couple of projects we have done was MVPs and didn't took of from that phase.</p>
<p>During 2023, we were getting less to no new projects, may be the market was down due to different economic situations. The projects we got also had very small budgets but there were significant features to do.</p>
<p>We brainstormed how we can achieve such a project. The solution was choose right frameworks for those projects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="javascript-eco-system">Javascript eco-system<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Javascript eco-system" title="Direct link to Javascript eco-system" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#javascript-eco-system">​</a></h3>
<p>It is a mess, fragmented and mostly unopinionated. I think JS eco-system is relatively new compared to PHP, Ruby or Java, especially node js.</p>
<p>I give full support for choosing js based frameworks or libraries for startups which have enough funds to invent their wheel and move forward.</p>
<p>But our case was different. We always had to fight with the competition for money and timeline to get projects.</p>
<p>We learned next js, tried it for couple of projects which required SEO and features like payment and data processing.</p>
<p>We leaned Nest js (Backend framework based on Node js and express). WHich was somewhat opinionated.</p>
<p>We used AWS amplify, cognito, API gateway etc. But nothing has improved our speed in development.</p>
<p>Then in one e-commerce project we tried Strapi. Awesome, it was great for the speed. We learned everything about strapi and wondered how their team developed such a great system. It was opinionated and thus we didn't wanted to think extensively or to always reinvent the wheel. It was an eye opening experience for me.</p>
<p>I am now exploring about other languages and frameworks that we could use achieve our projects easily and faster.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-frameworks-in-my-radar">Other frameworks in my radar<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other frameworks in my radar" title="Direct link to Other frameworks in my radar" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#other-frameworks-in-my-radar">​</a></h3>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laravel">Laravel<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laravel" title="Direct link to Laravel" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#laravel">​</a></h4>
<p>I know PHP is not as good as javascript, but PHP within Laravel was good. Now, I am learning Laravel. Laravel has the batteries to complete a project, I don't want to spend hours finding an npm package for authentication, encryption, ORM etc. I can start a Laravel project and start writing projects.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think I am not the brightest minds you find in the programming world. I am a person with an average IQ, with ADHD and a severe neck pain. But I have to do my job, make my client happy and make a living out of my work.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ruby on Rails" title="Direct link to Ruby on Rails" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/my-preferred-tech-stacks-for-different-projects#ruby-on-rails">​</a></h4>
<p>I never learned Ruby but there are strong fans for Ruby on Rails. I know DHH, and I agree with most of his choices in the business and programming. I have read an great reddit post on a senior engineer supporting Ruby over Rails, link is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1dkcegr/im_switching_from_laravel_to_rails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you like to see something like laravel for Javascript you should check Adonis JS. If you want to do project faster but not to learn a new language as a javascript developer, choose Adonis. Check their website <a href="https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/preface/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>I think Adonis is the unsung hero in the Javascript Eco-system.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Figma</strong> - Yes, you need to know it as a freelancer or independent web service provider. If you can't do it, outsource it to a good UI/UX designer. Clients value good designs.</li>
<li><strong>Photoshop</strong> - Optional. If you need to create great looking posters, assets etc. You need it. If you can't afford it check <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Affinity Photo</a>.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong> - It is hard to tell that I still struggle with css after 5 years of my programming. I am learning CSS over anything.</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> - Do you know HTML well, good HTML knowledge is needed for creating better SEO optimized sites.</li>
<li><strong>Next js</strong> - Use Next js for any kind of website work. It is so flexible but there is a learning curve.</li>
<li><strong>Strapi CMS</strong> - I cannot express more about my love towards Strapi to build CMS faster. Till I complete my Laravel learning, Strapi is my go to for my project.</li>
<li><strong>Laravel</strong> - I like it since it is opinionated. I am learning it since I want to deliver projects faster and cost effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Framer</strong> - If your client want a website immediately or unsure about want exactly she needs to put there after couple of months. Don't go coding, go for <a href="https://framer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framer</a>.</li>

<p>This is the only question I ask when communicating with my client and team.
Choose the framework for the needs, don't be a fan of a language or framework. Its all about making the client and their customers happy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>People with ADHD have poor attention &amp; high impulsivity.
People with ADHD can have hyper-focus in things they really enjoy or intrigued by but they cannot simple focus on things that don't want to do. In real life most of the things we do for living are not things we are interested to.</p>

<p>One of the major challenge ADHD people face is the time perception. This is the reason why they procrastinate. But the interesting thing is that if they are given a deadline they can somehow perceive time very well.</p>

<p>People with ADHD can have terrific memory of the past events, upcoming events however one vital memory called working memory is not proper for them.</p>
<p>Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain so that you can use it in immediate or short term. Example if someone verbally given their phone number and when you tries to type on your phone/ book you forget it immediately.</p>

<p>It is a neuro-modulator and creates hightened state of focus. It tends to shrink our visual world and it makes us pay attention to the things outside and beyond the confines of our skin/ physical work. Dopamine is a drive to do something in the physical world.</p>
<p>It also has role in changing the way we perceive the world.</p>
<p>Proper production of dopamine will narrow our visual and auditory world.</p>

<p>There are 2 main circuits w.r.t attention and dopamine in ADHD.</p>
<ol>
<li>Default mode network</li>
<li>Task Mode Network</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-default-mode-network">1. Default Mode Network<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Default Mode Network" title="Direct link to 1. Default Mode Network" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#1-default-mode-network">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Network which are active when we are not doing anything.</li>
<li>Default mode network include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (front-top-side part of the brain ).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-task-mode-network">2. Task mode Network<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Task mode Network" title="Direct link to 2. Task mode Network" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#2-task-mode-network">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Network which is goal oriented. It is a different set of brain area from default mode Network.</li>
<li>It is also in prefrontal cortex but in different part to default mode network. It is at Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPC in short, Front Centre part of the brain ).</li>
<li>MPC communicates with other parts of the brain mainly to suppress the impulses. It is shutting down your desire to stand up or scratch the side of the cheek.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there is communication btw task mode and default mode networks.</p>
<p>The two networks have a lot of communication in a neuro-typical person. But in a person with ADHD or a person with low sleep the 2 networks are not synchronized.</p>
<p>In a neuro-typical person the default mode and task mode networks are anti-correlated. That is they are opposing to each other to balance one another. But in a person with ADHD these 2 networks are co-related and they cannot control or balance each other.</p>
<p>What #dopamine is doing in this context is that it is acting as a conductor in a musical concert which make sure which mode should be active at a particular time. That is dopamine make them anti-correlated and helps balance each other.</p>
<p>This raises 2 questions in ADHD, whether #dopamine is not sufficiently high enough levels or #dopamine conducting everything wrong.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="low-dopamine-in-adhd-stimulant-use-and-abuse">Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse.<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse." title="Direct link to Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse." href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#low-dopamine-in-adhd-stimulant-use-and-abuse">​</a></h2>
<p>In year 2015m a research paper came but in an excellent journal in Biological Psychiatry (Author name: Spencer). This paper normalizes the fact of low dopamine hypothesis in ADHD.</p>
<p>It explains when dopamine levels are too low in particular areas of the brain, it leads to unnecessary firing of the neurons in the brain which is unrelated to the task we are trying to do. It can be like an instrumental concert without a conductor.</p>
<p>Even before such dopamine deficient hypothesis, in 1940s and 1960s we can see such people with ADHD tend to use recreational drugs or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants such as coffee, espresso or smoking half pack of cigarettes. Some others with access to street drugs they used cocaine, amphetamine etc.</p>
<p>All these drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the brain especially in the regions which regulate attention and task related and default mode networks.</p>
<p>Some children who do not have access to any of these drugs can be seen easting too much sugary food, coke which creates a sudden rush in dopamine.This makes them able to calm themselves. But when children who do not have ADHD consumes this they will become hyperactive due to enormously high production of dopamine.</p>
<p><strong>"LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE WITH ADHD."</strong></p>
<p>Thus giving dopamine energic compounds to people with ADHD will somehow increase the ability to focus.</p>

<p>People with ADHD will have attentional blink which is a condition when you are in a race for finding multiple things, you may involved in finding one of them but misses the second one. For e.e. reading a documentation and finding a single thing but misses others, this is because ADHD people are over focused in finding a particular piece of information. This is called as <strong>attentional blinks</strong> and it is more in ADHD people than in normal people.</p>

<p>People with ADHD may not have a good "introspective awareness". They can clearly hear these internal body changes but will not have a mentality to track it.</p>
<p>There is an exercise that could improve the focus by increasing the introspective awareness.</p>
<strong style="color:red;background:yellow">A 17 minute (exact)introspective exercise have seen to gain improvements in one's ability to focus for large periods of time.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Dopamine</li>
<li>Norepinephrine</li>
<li>Serotonin</li>
<li>Acetylcholine</li>
</ul>
<p>All these chemicals play a vital role in coˀˀgnitive focus.</p>
<p>Some prescription drugs that improve these chemical. Explained in detail at <a href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#drugs">drugs section</a> above.</p>
<p>Some other drugs</p>
<ul>
<li>Modafinil and Armodafinil</li>
<li>Alpha GPC</li>
<li>L - Tyrosine</li>
<li>Racetams and Noopept</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Modafinil is highly expensive (800 to 1000 dollars per month).</li>
<li>Armodafinil is a lesser expensive version of modafinil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike Ritalin &amp; Addrell, Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil are weak dopamine re-update inhibitors and thats how they lead ti increase in dopamine.
Modafinil helps to sustain a lower dose of dopamine in brain for a longer time.</p>
<p>Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil also affects other systems such as orexin system (it regulates hunger) and also regulate sleep.</p>

<p>Huberman took a flight to take a lecture but he had a headache due to jet lag. He was prescribed Armodafinil and he took very small dose. He took a straight four hour lecture without break due to that drug and he was so pumped up, so that a college needed to tell him most of the people got out of room due to time duration and he need to take a break. He mention this an insane scenario.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alpha-gpc-on-acetylcholine">Alpha GPC on Acetylcholine<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alpha GPC on Acetylcholine" title="Direct link to Alpha GPC on Acetylcholine" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#alpha-gpc-on-acetylcholine">​</a></h3>
<p>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that are at the neurons to muscle connections called neuromuscular connections which helps movements of muscles of all kind.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is produced in two sites of the brain</p>
<ol>
<li>Projections in the brain stem, like a sprinkle system which release Acetylcholine.</li>
<li>Set of neurons at the basel forebrain called Nucleus Basalis which simply means nucleus of the base.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drugs that enhances the production of Acetylcholine improves focus and cognition. One such drug/compound is Alpha GPC.</p>
<p>Dosage of Alpha GPC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower 200 to 300mg</li>
<li>Higher 1200mg</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="l--tyrosine">L -Tyrosine<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to L -Tyrosine" title="Direct link to L -Tyrosine" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#l--tyrosine">​</a></h3>
<p>It is an amino acid which is pre-cursor to the dopamine. L - Tyrosine helps production of dopamine, They are fairly long lived and it helps in focus but the dosage is very tricky.</p>
<p>It sometimes makes us euphoric and alert despite taking a regular dosage.</p>
<p>Dosage varies from 100mg to 1200mg. It should be used with caution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racetams-and-noopept">Racetams and Noopept<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Racetams and Noopept" title="Direct link to Racetams and Noopept" href="https://my-blog-pu0.pages.dev/blog/adhd-andrew-huberman-podcast-summary#racetams-and-noopept">​</a></h3>
<p>It is illegal in some countries. It can be seen in gray markets.</p>
<p>They have different margins of safety. you should definitely consult a doctor for this.</p>
<p>Noopept is a Recetam, it taps into the Cholinergic system, the Acetylcholine system which is very similar to Alpha-GPC but shown a heightened level of cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>For people involved in head trauma or injury have shown high efficacy with Recetams.</p>

<p>A broad study proposes a finding:</p>
<strong style="color:red"><p>An adult should restrict daily phone usage under 60 minutes a day.</p></strong>
<p>The study took data from over 700 individuals with smartphones, it is a large sample size, so the findings are fairly accurate</p>
