## How is ADHD ?

People with ADHD have poor attention & high impulsivity.
People with ADHD can have hyperfocus in things they really enjoy or intriged by but they cannot simple focus on things that don't want to do. In real life most of the things we do for living are not things we are interested to.

## Time perception

One of the major challenge ADHD people face is the time perception. This is the reason why they procrastinate. But the interesting thing is that if they are given a deadline they can somehow perceive time very well.

## Piling system

ADHD people use a piling system for organising and most of the time it may not work for them.

## Working memory

People with ADHD can have teriffic memory of the past events, upcoming events however one vital memory called working memory is not proper for them.

Working memory is the ability to keep specific information online, to recycle it in your brain so that you can use it in immediate or short term. Example if someone verbally given their phone number and when you tries to type on your phone/ book you forget it immediately.

## Dopamine

It is a neuro-modulator and creates hightened state of focus. It tends to shrink our visual world and it makes us pay attention to the things outside and beyond the confines of our skin/ physical work. Dopamine is a drive to do something in the physical world.

It also has role in changing the way we perceive the world.

Proper production of dopamine will narrow our visual and auditory world.

## Neural circuits

There are 2 main cirucuits w.r.t attention and dopammine in ADHD.

1. Default mode network
2. Task Mode Network

### 1. Default Mode Network

- Network which are active when we are not doing anything.
- Default mode network include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (front-top-side part of the brain ).

### 2. Task mode Network

- Network which is goal oriented. It is a different set of brain area from default mode Network.
- It is also in prefrontal cortex but in diffent part to default mode network. It is at Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPC in short, Front Centre part of the brain ).
- MPC communicates with other parts of the brain mainly to suppress the impulses. It is shutting down your desire to stand up or scratch the side of the cheek.

But there is communication btw task mode and default mode networks.

The two networks have a lot of communication in a neuro-typical person. But in a person with ADHD or a person with low sleep the 2 networks are not synchronized.

In a neuro-typical person the default mode and task mode networks are anti-correlated. That is they are opposing to each other to balance one another. But in a person with ADHD these 2 networks are co-related and they cannot control or balance each other.

What #dopamine is doing in this context is that it is acting as a conductor in a musical concert which make sure which mode should be active at a particular time. That is dopamine make them anti-corelated and helps balance each other.

This raises 2 questions in ADHD, whether #dopamine is not sufficiantly high enough levels or #dopamine conducting everything wrong.

## Low dopamine in ADHD, Stimulant use and Abuse.

In year 2015m a research paper came but in an excellent journal in Biological Psychary (Author name: Spencer). This paper normalises the fact of low dopamine hypothesis in ADHD.

It explains when dopammine levels are too low in particular areas of the brain, it leads to unnecessary firing of the neurons in the brain which is unrelated to the task we are trying to do. It can be like an instrumental concert without a conductor.

Even brfore such dopamine defecient hypothesis, in 1940s and 1960s we can see such people with ADHD tend to use recreational drugs or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants such as coffee, expresso or smoking half pack of cigarattes. Some others with access to street drugs they used cocaine, amphethamine etc.

All these drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the brain especially in the regions which regulate attention and task related and default mode networks.

Some children who do not have acccess to any of these drugs can be seen easting too much sugary food, coke which creates a sudden rush in dopamine.This makes them able to calm themselves. But when children who do not have ADHD consumes this they will become hyperactive due to enormously high production of dopamine.

**"LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE WITH ADHD."**

Thus giving dopamine energic compounds to people with ADHD will somehow increase the ability to focus.

So major drugs developed and marketed by pharamaseutical companies are

1. Ritalin
2. Adderral
3. Modafinil

These all drugs will increase the levels of dopamine in the regions of brains that manages the 2 modes.
